proj_001,"Smart Traffic Management System","An intelligent traffic management system using computer vision and machine learning algorithms to optimize traffic flow in urban areas. The system employs real-time video analysis to detect vehicle density, classify vehicle types, and dynamically adjust traffic light timing. The novel approach combines deep learning models with reinforcement learning to adapt to changing traffic patterns throughout the day. Key innovations include edge computing deployment for low-latency processing and integration with existing traffic infrastructure without requiring major hardware upgrades."
proj_002,"Blockchain-based Supply Chain Transparency","A decentralized platform for tracking products through complex supply chains using blockchain technology and IoT sensors. The system provides end-to-end visibility from raw materials to final consumers, enabling verification of authenticity, sustainability claims, and ethical sourcing. Smart contracts automate compliance checking and payment processing between supply chain partners. The platform includes a mobile app for consumers to verify product authenticity by scanning QR codes, creating a new standard for supply chain transparency."
proj_003,"AI-Powered Mental Health Chatbot","An empathetic AI chatbot designed to provide initial mental health support and crisis intervention. The system uses natural language processing to understand emotional context and provides personalized responses based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. Advanced features include mood tracking, personalized coping strategies, and seamless escalation to human therapists when needed. The chatbot incorporates privacy-preserving machine learning techniques to improve responses while maintaining user confidentiality."
